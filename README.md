# OOP 

This course I learned about object oriented programming, a subject i had no previous knowledge whatsoever, this is a programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point.

The main objective here was to introduce a programming mindset, so that when we are presented with a situation we can observe and interpret the info within the spectrum of a programming mindset.

The main benefits of using OOP 
* Models complex things in simple, reproductible structures
* Promotes reusability across programs
* Allow fir class-specific behavior using polymorphism
* Easier to debug
* More secure, protects information through encapsulation

There are 4 *Elements* and 4 *Principles*

Elements:
* *Clases* are essentialy *user defined data types* and its where we create a blueprint for           structure of methods and attributes.
  
* *Attributes* are information which is stored, they are defined in the *class* template.
  
* *Mothods* represent behaviors, they perform actions and may return information about and object.

* *Objects* are instances of classes created with specific data.

Principles:
* *Encapsulation* containing information in and object, exposing only selected information

* *Abstraction* only exposing high level public methods for accesing an object

* *Inheritance* Child classes inherit data and behaviors drom a parent class

* *Polymorphism* Many methods can do the same task

# TECHNOLOGIES
